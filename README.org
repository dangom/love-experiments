#+TITLE: LÖVE Experiments

This is my personal stimulus presentation software written with LÖVE. I use because it is lightweight, cross-platform, free and in my opinion easier to use than the alternatives.

To run the experiments, first install [[https://love2d.org/][LÖVE]] and then run `love experiment`, where experiment is a directory containing a =main.lua= file. See the examples in this repository.

Currently, =love-experiments= only supports flickering checkerboards, but it does the following:

- Logging of keypresses and scanner triggers in BIDS compatible format
- Log results even if the experiment exists early
- Display participants feedback at the end of the session
- Parse command line arguments

It is performant enough to run on resource starved computers.
