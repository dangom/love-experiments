This is my personal fMRI stimulus presentation software. Its goal are to be lightweight, cross-platform, free and easier to use than the alternatives without sacrificing temporal precision. The experiments are programmed in Lua using the LÖVE 2D framework for game development since it aligns with all of the goals described above and provides sufficient and adequate timing precision. Another advantage of this choice is that the framework is widely used and has a thriving and welcoming community, making it easy to find help if necessary.

To run the experiments, first install [[https://love2d.org/][LÖVE]] and then run `love experiment`, where experiment is a directory containing a =main.lua= file. See the examples in this repository.

Currently, =love-experiments= only provides flickering checkerboards and flickering scaled noise experiments, since these are the ones I've been using in my own experiments. Nonetheless, the software takes care of the following:

- Logging of keypresses and scanner triggers in close to BIDS compatible format
- Log results even if the experiment exits early or fails
- Display participants feedback at the end of the session
- Parse command line arguments for more flexibility
- Keyboard agnostic

As currently implemented, the code is also performant enough to run on resource starved computers without dropping any single frame.
